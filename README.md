A small Clojure library for representing LISP expressions in infix
rather than prefix notation... sometimes it's easier to rely on operator precedence,
instead of LISP's insistence on parentheses – this is especially true when dealing
with mathematical equations.

An infix expression is rewritten as a prefix expression using a macro. The operator
precedence rules were taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations#Programming_languages).
Any function calls should _generally_ have parens around the arguments and not the function name. Aliased unary operators
(as outlined below) do not need parens however.

### Pre-requisites

You will need [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) 2.6.1 or above installed.

### Building

To build and install the library locally, run:

    $ cd infix
    $ lein test
    $ lein install

### Including in your project

There is a version hosted at [Clojars](https://clojars.org/rm-hull/infix).
For leiningen include a dependency:

```clojure
[rm-hull/infix "0.4.0"]
```

For maven-based projects, add the following to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>rm-hull</groupId>
  <artifactId>infix</artifactId>
  <version>0.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## API Documentation

See [www.destructuring-bind.org/infix](http://www.destructuring-bind.org/infix/) for API details.

## Basic Usage

```clojure
(use 'infix.macros)
; => nil

(infix 3 + 5 * 8)
; => 43

(infix (3 + 5) * 8)
; => 64
```

You can also use `$=` as a short alias for `infix`, like this for example:

```clojure
(refer 'infix.macros :only '[$=])
; => nil

($= 3 + 5 * 8)
; => 43
```

All of the examples below should work if you replace `infix` by `$=`.

Some `Math` functions have been aliased (see [below](#aliased-operators--functions)
for full list), so nullary and unary-argument functions can be used as follows:

```clojure
(infix √(5 * 5))
; => 5.0

(infix √ 121)
; => 11.0

(infix 2 ** 6)
; => 64.0

(def t 0.324)
; => #'user/t

(infix sin(2 * t) + 3 * cos(4 * t))
; => 1.4176457261295824

(infix rand() * 3)
; => 0.5544039436207262
```

#### Debugging

It may be the case that you encounter some esoteric errors emitted from the
library trying to rephrase expressions from infix to prefix. Use
`macroexpand-1` to show how the expression would be rewritten, and if necessary
file an [issue](https://github.com/rm-hull/infix/issues/new).

```clojure
(macroexpand-1 '(infix sin(2 * t) + 3 * cos(4 * t))
; => (+ (Math/sin (* 2 t)) (* 3 (Math/cos (* 4 t))))
```

### Usage in ClojureScript projects

The `infix` macro may be used to expand infix expressions in ClojureScript code
by adding the require-macros directive to a namespace, for example:

```clojure
(ns my.clojurescript.project
  (:require-macros [infix.macros :refer [infix]]))
```

### Evaluating infix expressions dynamically from a string

A function can created at runtime from an expression held in a string as
follows. When building from a string, a number of binding arguments should be
supplied, corresponding to any variable that may be used in the string
expression, for example:

```clojure
(def hypot
  (from-string [x y]
    "sqrt(x**2 + y**2)"))
; => #'user/hypot

(hypot 3 4)
; => 5

(meta hypot)
; => {:params [:x :y], :doc "sqrt(x**2 + y**2)"}
```

`from-string` is deliberately designed to _look_ like an anonymous function
definition, mainly because that is more-or-less what it is. In effect, this is
equivalent to creating the following function:

```clojure
(def hypot
  (fn [x y]
    (infix sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2))))
```

However, it does so without recourse to `eval` and `read-string` - instead it is
built using our [old friend](https://github.com/rm-hull/jasentaa), the monadic
parser-combinator, with an EBNF grammar (implementing the infix notation) and a
restricted base environment of math functions, as outlined in the next section.

The `base-env` may be extended with any number of key/value pairs (where keys
are keywords) and values may either be values or functions, to provide
the required extensions. When referenced in the string it is **not** necessary
to prefix the name with a colon.

```clojure
(def extended-env
  (merge
    base-env
    {:rad (fn [deg] (infix deg * π / 180))
     :hypot hypot}))
; => user/extended-env

(def rhs-triangle-height
  (from-string [base angle]
    extended-env
    "tan(rad(angle)) * base"))
; => user/rhs-triangle-height

(rhs-triangle-height 10 45)
; => 9.9999999999998
```

Obviously, a function that was previously created from a string can also
referenced in a subsequent function definition:

```clojure
(def hypot2
  (from-string [x y]
    extended-env
    "hypot(x, y) ** 2"))
; => user/hypot2

(hypot2 5 12)
; => 169.0
```

## EBNF Grammar Rules

The `from-string` macro parses infix expressions based on the EBNF
[grammar rules](https://github.com/rm-hull/infix/blob/master/src/infix/grammar.clj)
as follows:

- _**&lt;expression&gt;** ::= term { addop term }._

- _**&lt;term&gt;** ::= factor { mulop factor }._

- _**&lt;factor&gt;** ::= base { expop base }._

- _**&lt;base&gt;** ::= "(" expression ")" | boolean | number | var | function._

- _**&lt;addop&gt;** ::= "+" | "-" | "|" | "&" | "||" | "&&"._

- _**&lt;mulop&gt;** ::= "\*" | "/" | "÷" | "%" | ">>" | ">>>" | "<<"._

- _**&lt;expop&gt;** ::= "\*\*" ._

- _**&lt;function&gt;** ::= envref expression | envref "(" &lt;empty&gt; | expression { "," expression } ")"._

- _**&lt;ternary&gt;** ::= "(" expression ")" "?" expression ":" expression._

- _**&lt;envref&gt;** ::= letter { letter | digit | "_" }.\_

- _**&lt;var&gt;** ::= envref._

- _**&lt;boolean&gt;** ::= "true" | "false"_

- _**&lt;number&gt;** ::= integer | decimal | rational | binary | hex_

- _**&lt;binary&gt;** :: = [ "-" ] "0b" { "0" | "1" }._

- _**&lt;hex&gt;** :: = [ "-" ] "0x" | "#" { "0" | ... | "9" | "A" | ... | "F" | "a" | ... | "f" }._

- _**&lt;integer&gt;** :: = [ "-" ] digits._

- _**&lt;decimal&gt;** :: = [ "-" ] digits "." digits._

- _**&lt;rational&gt;** :: = integer "/" digits._

- _**&lt;letter&gt;** ::= "A" | "B" | ... | "Z" | "a" | "b" | ... | "z"._

- _**&lt;digit&gt;** ::= "0" | "1" | ... | "8" | "9"._

- _**&lt;digits&gt;** ::= digit { digit }._
